What did you build?
I built a basketball game where you have to take your chances of getting the rare items such as a croissant or watermelon and win the game by dunking the rarest item, Mr. Gardner.

What language(s) or tools did you use?
JavaScript, CSS and HTML were all used as languages in this project. Used google for images.

Which AI tools did you use, and how?
Gemini and Copilot were the AI used to create this project. I asked them what I wanted them to add to the code and copy and pasted to Visual Studio.

What did you do versus what AI helped with?
I had to organize the code if the AI gave me snippets. Organized images. Added needed files. And needed to test and debug since the AI can't test the code.

What’s one thing you’re proud of?
The idea of an interactive basketball game especially when it doesn't even look like it uses JS.

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
The visuals, physics and more features for the program. Making it more appealing to the eye, while making the physics make more sense will make it for a better playing experience. Adding more features can make it enjoyable for longer periods of time.
